                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p align="justify">
                    <big>The Expressive Encounters Workshop is an official workshop of The European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) 2024, which will take place in Milano, Italy. Accepted paper submissions will be included in the Springer post-conference proceedings.</big>
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    <big>Virtual embodied agents and robots are increasingly integrated into our daily lives, serving roles such as receptionists in public services, home assistants, virtual personal trainers, and coaches for physical and mental health activities. To ensure user acceptance and trust, it is essential to design these agents to be not only functionally complex and useful but also understandable and socially appropriate. People are more likely to accept such technologies when they perceive them as extensions of themselves. Therefore, human-human interaction, which incorporates not only language but also non-verbal communication that is richer in terms of social and cultural features, serves as a natural model for designing the behaviours of such agents. Consequently, there has been a significant effort in recent years to generate non-verbal gestures for agents automatically in a data-driven manner.</big>
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    <big>This workshop aims to advance the development of real-world applications that involve virtual embodied agents and robots. To ensure user acceptance and trust, such real-world applications require new generative models and evaluation methods to generate socially appropriate non-verbal behaviours, considering cultural and personal factors, as well as enable real-time processing (i.e., understanding and responding to the user on the fly). </big>
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    <big>The workshop will have two main tracks:</big>
                </p>
                <big>
                    <ul style="list-style-position: inside;">
                        <li style="text-align: left;">Track 1: Real-time non-verbal behaviour generation and addressing behaviour generation with personal factors (e.g., culture, personality)</li>
                        <li style="text-align: left;">Track 2: Gesture generation deployed on a real-world embodied agent</li>
                    </ul>
                </big>
                <p align="justify">
                    <big>The workshop aims to bring together researchers working on the abovementioned areas of non-verbal behaviour generation to discuss the future of this field. To kickstart these discussions, we invite all interested researchers to submit a paper for presentation at the workshop, to either of the tracks.</big>
                </p>

                    <big>
                        We will accept <b>long</b> and <b>short</b> paper submissions, all in the style of the <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science/kzwwpvhwnvfj#.WuA4JS5uZpi">official ECCV 2024 template</a>. <b>Short papers</b> are limited to 4 pages, and <b>long papers</b> should not exceed 8 pages, including figures and tables, in the LNCS style of Springer. Additional pages containing only cited references are allowed. Submissions will be processed in a  single-blind review process, therefore the submitted formatting should indicate authors and acknowledgements/funding information and comply with the page limit.
                    </big>

                    <big>
                        At the workshop, we will host a poster session for the two tracks, and the best papers from each track will be invited to give an oral presentation of their work. An accepted paper submission is required to participate in the poster session.
