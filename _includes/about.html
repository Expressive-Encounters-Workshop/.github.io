                    <big>Virtual embodied agents and robots are increasingly integrated into our daily lives, serving roles such as receptionists in public services, home assistants, virtual personal trainers, and coaches for physical and mental health activities. To ensure user acceptance and trust, it is essential to design these agents to be not only functionally complex and useful but also understandable and socially appropriate. People are more likely to accept such technologies when they perceive them as extensions of themselves. Therefore, human-human interaction, which incorporates not only language but also non-verbal communication that is richer in terms of social and cultural features, serves as a natural model for designing the behaviours of such agents. Consequently, there has been a significant effort in recent years to generate non-verbal gestures for agents automatically in a data-driven manner.</big>

                    <big>This workshop aims to advance the development of real-world applications that involve virtual embodied agents and robots. To ensure user acceptance and trust, such real-world applications require new generative models and evaluation methods to generate socially appropriate non-verbal behaviours, considering cultural and personal factors, as well as enable real-time processing (i.e., understanding and responding to the user on the fly).</big>

                    <big><b><big>TRACK SCOPES</big></b><br>
                    Our tracks provide a comprehensive exploration of behavior generation for virtual and embodied agents. These tracks focus on developing techniques for real-time non-verbal behavior generation, addressing personal factors such as culture and personality, and deploying gesture generation on real-world embodied agents. Each track offers researchers a platform to collaborate and innovate, bridging disciplines like computer vision, natural language processing, and human-computer interaction to create more socially aware and culturally sensitive agent interactions.
