                    <big>This Workshop aims to advance the development of real-world applications involving virtual and embodied agents by focusing on generating socially appropriate non-verbal behavior, considering cultural and personal factors, and emphasizing real-time processing for user acceptance and trust.</big>

                    <big><b><big>TRACK SCOPES</big></b><br>
                    Our tracks provide a comprehensive exploration of behavior generation for virtual and embodied agents. These tracks focus on developing techniques for real-time non-verbal behavior generation, addressing personal factors such as culture and personality, and deploying gesture generation on real-world embodied agents. Each track offers researchers a platform to collaborate and innovate, bridging disciplines like computer vision, natural language processing, and human-computer interaction to create more socially aware and culturally sensitive agent interactions.
